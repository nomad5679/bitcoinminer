# OSHash
A fun base for a bitcoin miner. The miner is currently not implemented and is more of a fun console project.
# How to Use
I reccoment going to repl.it, signing up for a free acount and copying the code into it.
# What does it do?
All it is at the moment is more of a prank miner. It has a nice console base and some other fun things. I may try to implement a actual miner in the future, but for now it is just for fun.
